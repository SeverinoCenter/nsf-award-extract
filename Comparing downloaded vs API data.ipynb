      "    api:  The NSF Graduate STEM Fellows in K-12 Education (GK-12) Program supported fellowships and training for graduate students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  The goal of the program was to provide opportunities for graduate students to improve their communication skills by fostering interactions with teachers and students in K-12 schools and to enrich STEM content and instruction in K-12 schools.   From 2009 through 2016 in partnership with the Savannah Chatham County Public School System (SCPSS) in Savannah Georgia, the University of Georgia Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO) collaborated with Savannah State University (SSU) to host the GK-12 program \"Ocean Literacy in a Coastal Community through Science Education and Estuarine Monitoring\".  SSU is a historically black university that offers graduate degrees (MS) in Marine Sciences, SkIO is an internationally respected oceanographic research institute, and African-American students are over-represented in the SCPSS compared to the national average.  The goals of this project were to 1) build Ocean Literacy and sustainable partnerships at SSU that would enhance both education and research in the Southeast USA and 2) to increase the engagement of underrepresented students in the ocean sciences.   The components of the program included 1) engaging SSU graduate students in coastal relevant research, 2) pairing graduate students with K-12 educators to assist in teaching and infuse K-12 classrooms with Ocean Literacy content. The presence of graduate students in these classrooms allowed more hands on and lab activities to be conducted than would have otherwise been possible.  A third component of the project was to offer opportunities for educators to increase their Ocean Literacy by offering content-rich workshops, internships, research cruise experiences, field work, and mentorship experiences.     During the project 25 marine science graduate students served as \"resident scientists\" in local science classrooms ranging from elementary through high school. As reported by the students who completed these residences, these experiences were a transformative component of their graduate experience that improved their communication and teaching skills. Also as a result of this program a strong partnership was developed with Savannah-Chatham public schools that we expect to continue well beyond the completion of this project. Reciprocally, K-12 educators who participated in the program report increasing their Ocean Literacy and their appreciation of the research process. Many of the educators report that they regularly include information and the insights gained in their classrooms.   The impact of the SSU/SkIO GK 12 program is likely to be sustained.  So far, 20 (80%) of the fellows have graduated, while 5 are completing their thesis projects.  44% of the GK-12 graduate fellows have been from groups underrepresented in the geosciences and they served a school system that is 57% African American and 67% economically disadvantaged. Pre-tests and post-test results showed improvement in basic Ocean Literacy in local classrooms and in educators that participated in the workshops. The classroom immersion and effective mentor-mentee relationships resulted in a large fraction of the former fellows (32%) going on to careers in science education including college instruction, high school instruction, and informal education at public aquaria. Others are employed with governmental agencies (NOAA), in university and commercial labs, or at non-profit agencies. Three of the graduates are now enrolled in PhD programs. Through refinement of instructional strategies, by the last year of the project, 100% of active fellows submitted science education articles for publication. To date 34 publications and 113 presentations have resulted from this program. Data from GK-12 research cruises and the Skidaway River time-series monitoring program have been archived and are routinely used by SSU faculty and students for theses, senior research projects, class projects, and proposals.

      "    api:  Phase I Outcomes Summary      In Phase I of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, Chiral Photonics, Inc. (CPI) developed, demonstrated and now manufactures novel coupling technology, called the Pitch Reducing Optical Fiber Array (PROFA) that is designed to meet optical data-channel input and output (I/O) demands of next-generation telecommunications systems, data centers and cloud computing. As channel signal rates increase well above 10 Gb/s (ten billion bits per second), designers are moving from electrical to optical lines for communication both within and external to integrated circuits, or \"chips\" to provide higher information bandwidth, more densely spaced channels occupying less area, and lower power consumption. The need for efficient (low loss) optical couplers to interface one or more optical channels between the ubiquitous, global optical fiber infrastructure and emerging photonic integrated circuits (PIC) technology, which combines electronics with optical components on the same chip, was the focus of this Phase I effort. PROFA enables optical waveguides to be spaced 10 times closer than otherwise possible with conventional fiber-based couplers. PROFAs facilitate improved PIC I/O and packaging as well as high density connectors that promise to mitigate fiber congestion and simplify system connections. PROFAs also enable a practical interface to multicore fiber, emerging for high speed telecommuincations, sensing applications, as well as efficient combiners for high power lasers. No other technology has achieved this level of channel density.     PROFA, shown in figure 1, is based on a microformed glass taper, in which a specially prepared assembly of glass channels is heated to the softening point of the glass while it is drawn through and tapered in an environmentally clean, laser driven oven. The specially designed optical channels in the PROFA couple with low loss to both standard optical fibers at the wide end and to densely spaced waveguides on a chip at the narrow end where all of the individual signal carrying cores from the individual optical fibers are arranged in a uniformly spaced hexagonal pattern as shown in figure 2.     Figure 1. Pitch Reducing Optical Fiber Array     Although originally targeting a 7 channel PROFA as the goal for Phase I, CPI successfully demonstrated 61 channel PROFA devices. As shown in figure 2 the channel spacing was reduced from 250 micrometers between individual standard fibers at the wide end of the device to 35 micrometers in a uniformly spaced hexagonal grid at the tapered end. The channel consistency and uniformity of spacing is ideal for coupling to either single channel or multichannel waveguide arrays on either the edges or face of photonic integrated circuits. CPI has laid the groundwork for potential large scale deployment and production of this novel technological advance in optical data transport that bridges a major connectivity gap between the standard optical fiber and PIC technology. In Phase I CPI, developed the computer controlled machinery and mechanical fixtures necessary to assemble and microform the glass components with the accuracy required. In addition, CPI has developed automated, computer based diagnostic tools that work with advanced spectrum analyzers, power meters and microscope images of the PROFA to characterize the performance of PROFA devices.     Figure 2. 61 channel PROFA     CPI will build on the success of Phase I to use the PROFA technology as the basis for developing chip attach and packaging for the developers of photonic integrated circuits in Phase II. This will entail CPI developing a fully packaged solution for a photonic integrated circuit which is coupled to one or more PROFA devices. The package will handle both optical and electrical interface between the photonic integrated circuit and the external environment. The package will be environmentally rugged and can be hermetically sealed against moisture ingress, ...\n",

      "    api:  The project made significant advances in our ability to predict structural performance properties of wood elements relevant for mass timber construction.  These advances were accomplished through a computational modeling approach that mimics the morphology of wood such that the critical features that dictate structural properties are explicitly represented.  The model properties were assigned based on small scale fracture tests.  Additional work led to a model that captures the time and moisture dependent properties of the material that affect long term serviceability of structures.  The intellectual merit of the work lies in the innovative way the computational model can capture material properties at a scale approaching the individual wood fiber (see accompanying figure), which is in fact the scale that is relevant for numerous structural properties, but is typically glossed over due to the computational expense. The experiments complemented the modeling effort by quantifying the magnitude of the different failure mechanisms at the fiber scale.  The broader impact of the work lies in the way we have enhanced our predictive capabilities for mass timber construction.  Mass timber in general, and cross laminated timber (CLT) in particular, is structural technology that can provide immediate reductions in the carbon footprint of the building envelope.  The results of this research will enable designers to further push the boundaries of what is possible in wood construction, and will provide better predictive abilities for innovative new designs.  Additional broader impacts lie in the collaboration of the research team with the Northwestern Architecture Design and Engineering undergraduate program, where students applied new timber design technologies into their class projects.
